## Description

Many social networking platforms are founded on enormous amount of data and it's important to understand how to build and structure these APIs. Likewise, this application generates an API for a social network web application, where users can share their thoughts, react to friends' thoughts, and create a friend list. It uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
